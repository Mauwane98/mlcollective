                <h2>ML Collective started as Mauwane Leatherworks</h2>
                <p>Founded by Rapudi Moses Mauwane in 1986, he worked a 9-to-5 job but left due to challenges at work. To support his family, he started making leather belts and turned it into a business. He was dedicated to his craft and worked hard to perfect every piece he made. He wanted people to have high-quality leather products that lasted for years. Even though he worked hard, he knew his business had the potential to grow into something much bigger. But he faced many challenges—he was getting older, and he lacked the resources to expand. Despite these struggles, he never gave up.</p>
                <p>He always dreamed that one day, someone with a modern mindset would take the business to new heights. He didn’t want his skills and hard work to die with him. He wanted the business to live on, evolve, and reach new heights.</p>

                <h2>The Evolution – Honoring the Past, Embracing the Future</h2>
                <p>Today, we are proud to continue his legacy. We rebranded as ML Collective to honor his hard work while allowing the business to grow beyond leather belts. We still focus on quality leather products, but in the future, we plan to expand into clothing, accessories, and other ventures.</p>

                <h2>Why "ML Collective"?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"ML" keeps our connection to Mauwane Leatherworks, honoring our history.</li>
                    <li>"Collective" represents our future—a space for creativity, innovation, and potential growth into fashion, accessories, and beyond.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                <p>We are not just continuing a business; we are preserving a legacy. ML Collective is a tribute to my grandfather’s vision—a brand that carries forward his passion for quality, craftsmanship, and innovation. While leather goods remain our specialty today, we are laying the foundation for something bigger, ensuring that his dream thrives, evolves, and inspires for generations to come.</p>
